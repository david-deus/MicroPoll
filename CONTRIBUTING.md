# Contributing to MicroPoll

Thank you for your interest in contributing! We want to maintain clear guidelines to keep contributions focused and high quality.

## 🚦 Before you code

1. Check existing issues — maybe someone already suggested your idea  
2. If no issue exists for your enhancement / bug, **open a new issue first**, using our Feature or Bug templates (.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE)  
3. In your issue, describe the problem or feature, propose a design / plan, and any relevant context  

## 📌 Issue Types and Labels

We use these labels to help contributors choose tasks:

| Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `good-first-issue` | Small, self-contained tasks ideal for first-time contributors |
| `help-wanted` | Larger features or improvements open for contribution |
| `bug` | Issues indicating bugs |
| `enhancement` | Feature requests or improvements |
| `documentation` | Docs, examples, readmes, API docs |
| `spam` | PRs judged to be spammy / low quality — will not be accepted or counted |

## 🧑‍💻 Submit a Pull Request (PR)

When you're ready:

1. Fork → clone your fork → create a branch (`git checkout -b feature/xyz` or `bugfix/abc`)  
2. Write tests if applicable  
3. Ensure your code passes existing tests / lint / format rules  
4. Update docs / README / examples if needed  
5. When opening PR, use the **Pull Request Template**  
6. If your change is significant, link to the relevant issue in your PR  
7. Be patient — maintainers will review promptly; they may request changes  

### PR Review & Acceptance

- We aim to respond to PRs within **48–72 hours**  
- Small tweaks or documentation may be merged directly  
- Larger changes may require discussion or iteration  
- Once approved, PRs will be merged *or* labeled `hacktoberfest-accepted` if relevant  
- PRs clearly violating guidelines or judged spam will be labeled `spam` or `invalid` and closed  

## 📝 Coding Style & Guidelines

- Use consistent code style (indentation, naming) — follow existing style  
- Write clear, readable, commented code  
- Keep changes focused and minimal  
- Avoid committing generated files / compiled code / binaries unless necessary  
- Follow commit message convention (e.g. “feat: description”, “fix: description”, “docs: description”)  

## 🧪 Tests

- Add or update unit / integration tests when possible  
- Running `npm test` (or equivalent) should pass without errors  
- Try to include edge-case tests
