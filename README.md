**Topic:** `hacktoberfest`  

MicroPoll is a lightweight web application where users can create polls or surveys, share them, collect votes, and view results in real time. The goal is to ship a usable MVP by end of Hacktoberfest, with options for contributors to improve features, UI, and edge cases.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals / MVP Features

By end of Hacktoberfest, the MVP should include:

- User registration / login (optional, or anonymous polls)  
- Poll / survey creation (single question or multiple questions)  
- Voting interface (single-choice, multi-choice)  
- Real-time or near real-time results display (charts)  
- Poll shareable link  
- Basic mobile / responsive UI  
- Persist data (e.g. using a database or simple JSON / file storage)  

After MVP, possible enhancements: scheduling polls, anonymous mode, expiration date, export responses, better analytics, embedding polls, theming, etc.
