**Topic:** `hacktoberfest`  

MicroPoll is a lightweight web application where users can create polls or surveys, share them, collect votes, and view results in real time. The goal is to ship a usable MVP by end of Hacktoberfest, with options for contributors to improve features, UI, and edge cases.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals / MVP Features

By end of Hacktoberfest, the MVP should include:

- User registration / login (optional, or anonymous polls)  
- Poll / survey creation (single question or multiple questions)  
- Voting interface (single-choice, multi-choice)  
- Real-time or near real-time results display (charts)  
- Poll shareable link  
- Basic mobile / responsive UI  
- Persist data (e.g. using a database or simple JSON / file storage)  

After MVP, possible enhancements: scheduling polls, anonymous mode, expiration date, export responses, better analytics, embedding polls, theming, etc.

## ðŸš€ How to Contribute

 - We welcome contributors of all levels. Suggested ways to help:
 - Add new features (e.g. poll expiration, anonymous voting)
 - Improve UI/UX, accessibility, themes
 - Add tests / test coverage
 - Improve error handling, edge case handling
 - Write documentation, e.g. API docs, usage examples
 - Fix bugs / issues

Please read CONTRIBUTING.md for full guidelines.

## Labels & Hacktoberfest

 - Weâ€™ll mark specific issues with good-first-issue and help-wanted
 - Only PRs that meaningfully add value (feature, bug fix, docs, tests) will be accepted
 - Trivial or spammy PRs may be labeled spam or invalid and will not be counted toward Hacktoberfest contributions (per hacktoberfest rules)
